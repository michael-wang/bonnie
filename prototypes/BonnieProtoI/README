First prototype for Bonnie's Brunch project.

Target is simple, to make select level stage, user is able to scroll on screen object (sprite). Also do simple animation (little car below).

Scroll sprite: gesture scroll on any part of screen, scroll all level sprite. Support boundary detection and fit level sprite into slot.

Animation: play 2 images repeatedly, each showed for a specific period of time.
